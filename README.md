LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

You can:
  - Output your last 20 tweets
  - Output information about a song or a movie of your choice
  - Take input from a different local file and use it to call LIRI commands
 
> Output is logged in the terminal and in a local file.
